# Supporting Information for: Estimates of Phylogenetic Signal Based on Lambda are Often Inaccurate

*COPY FIGURES FROM FIGURES FOLDER INTO MANUSCRIPT FOLDER IN ORDER TO KNIT*

Here we provide additional supporting information referenced in the main document: additional analyses, and simulation results across a wider set of input conditions.


## Simulations on differently shaped phylogenies

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
  library(knitr)
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In addition to using pure-birth phylogenies, we explored the effect of tree shape on our findings using both balanced and pectinate trees. As before, simulations were conducted on a range of tree sizes ($n=2^5 - 2^{10}$), and across a range of input levels of phylogenetic signal ($\lambda_{in} = 0.0 \to 1.0$; in 21 intervals of 0.05 units). For each $n$ and $\lambda_{in}$ combination, 50 replicates of a continuous trait were simulated using a Brownian motion model of evolution. Using these, we estimated the degree of phylogenetic signal using $\lambda$. \hfill\break

*Results*. As found with pure-birth phylogenies, estimates of $\lambda$ varied most dramatically in simulations with fewer species and at intermediate values of lambda (Fig. S1, S2). Pectinate trees showed an interesting tendency to underestimate $/lambda$ as 0 for input $/lambda$ values. Most dramatically, some simulations on the largest pectinate phylogeny ($n = 1024$) estimated $/lambda = 0$ for input values as high as 0.75 (Fig. S2).

## Simulations of phylogenetic regression and ANOVA

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
  library(knitr)
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We analyzed the reliability of parameter estimations when used in phylogenetic regression and ANOVA. This involved simulations of dependent variables with $\lambda$ values ranging from 0 to 1 (21 intervals of 0.05 units) across pure-birth trees ($n=2^5 - 2^{10}$). For each $\lambda$ input value, independent variables were then generated with a known relationship ($\beta = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0$), from which $\lambda$ was then estimated.

*Results* As with the results from the regression analyses in the main text, we found limmited $\lambda$ estimation precision in smaller trees and at intermediate levels of phylogenetic signal with phylogenetic ANOVA (Fig. S3). Slope was reliably estimated across tree sizes and known $\lambda$ values (Fig. S4).
