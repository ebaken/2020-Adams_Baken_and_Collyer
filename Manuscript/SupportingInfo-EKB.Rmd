# Supporting Information for: Estimates of Phylogenetic Signal Based on Lambda are Often Inaccurate

Here we provide additional supporting information referenced in the main document: additional analyses, and simulation results across a wider set of input conditions.


## Simulations on differently shaped phylogenies

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
  library(knitr)
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In addition to using pure-birth phylogenies, we explored the effect of tree shape on our findings using both balanced and pectinate trees. As before, simulations were conducted on a range of tree sizes ($n=2^5 - 2^{10}$), and across a range of input levels of phylogenetic signal ($\lambda_{in} = 0.0 \to 1.0$; in 21 intervals of 0.05 units). For each $n$ and $\lambda_{in}$ combination, 50 replicates of a continuous trait were simulated using a Brownian motion model of evolution. Using these, we estimated the degree of phylogenetic signal using $\lambda$. \hfill\break

*Results*. As found with pure-birth phylogenies, estimates of $\lambda$ varied most dramatically in simulations with fewer species and at intermediate values of lambda (Fig. S1, S2). Pectinate trees showed an interesting tendency to underestimate $/lambda$ as 0 for input $/lambda$ values. Most dramatically, some simulations on the largest pectinate phylogeny ($n = 1024$) estimated $/lambda = 0$ for input values as high as 0.75 (Fig. S2).

## Simulations of phylogenetic regression and ANOVA

We analyzed the reliability of parameter estimations when used in phylogenetic regression and ANOVA. This involved simulations of dependent variables with $\lambda$ values ranging from 0 to 1 (21 intervals of 0.05 units) across pure-birth trees ($n=2^5 - 2^{10}$). For each $\lambda$ input value, independent variables were then generated with a known relationship to the simulated dependent variable ($\beta = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0$), from which $\lambda$ was then estimated.

*Results* As with the results from the regression analyses in the main text, we found poor precision of $\lambda$ estimation in smaller trees and at intermediate levels of phylogenetic signal with phylogenetic ANOVA (Fig. S3). Slope was reliably estimated across tree sizes and known $\lambda$ values (Fig. S4).

## Effect Sizes of Pagel's Lambda and Kappa 

In this manuscript, we propose the use of effect size (Z-scores) over raw metrics of phylogenetic signal. We quantified Z-scores for estimated values of Pagel's $\lambda$ and Kappa of simulated datasets to demonstrate the variable behavior of these effect sizes across tree size and input values of phylogenetic signal. Simulation procedures can be found in the main text.

*Results* Z scores of Pagel's $\lambda$ show a dramatically non-linear pattern across values of known $\lambda$ across all tree sizes (Figure S5). On the other hand, variation in the Kappa Z-scores is consistent across input $\lambda$s and shows a nearly linear relationship. Furthermore the variation of $Z_K$ is fairly consistent across values of input $\lambda$ indicating that $Z_K$ is an accurate and reliable statistic and can be appropriately used when comparing values of phylogenetic signal across clades or traits.
