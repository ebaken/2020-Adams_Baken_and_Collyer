Figure \[fig:frog\] shows an example of how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. Figures wider than one
column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide.

\caption{Response of effect sizes \(Z_\lambda\) and \(Z_\kappa\) to
increasing strength of Brownian motion.{}}
\end{figure}


##NOTE: need to figure out how to force placement etc.
