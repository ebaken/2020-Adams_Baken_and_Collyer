In this paper we demonstrate that the two most widely-used measures of phylogenetic signal: Pagel's lambda and Blomberg's kappa, are not effect sizes and thus cannot be used to compare the relative strength of phylogenetic signal in phenotypic data. Thus, comments on 'strong' or 'weak' phylogenetic signal based on these measures have little meaning. However, we then derive a Z-score for kappa and show that it has appropriate properties to serve as an effect size for this purpose. Further a two-sample test we propose allows one to statistically determine whether the strength of phylogenetic signal in one dataset is greater or less than that displayed in another.
